      <h1>Wounds and Healing</h1>
      <h2>Death</h2>
      <p>A Player Character will die if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They take massive damage from a single source or attack equal to or exceeding double their Hit Point Maximum.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OR:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are reduced to 0 Hit Points while already having 2 wounds.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Taking Wounds</h2>
      <p>When a PC’s Hit Points are reduced to 0, but they aren’t killed, they will take a <a href="5.1 Wounds.html" target="_blank">Wound</a>. The first wound will always be a Minor Wound, but the second wound may be a Critical Wound if it was the result of critical damage. Wounds have different effects, often determined by the type of damage received. Critical Wounds have permanent effects which may significantly impact and transform your character. Whenever you take a Critical Wound, you must make a CON save (usually with a difficulty of 15). On a failure, you fall unconscious.</p>
      <p>After you take a wound, you regain half of your maximum Hit Points, rounded down. (You will always restore a minimum of 1 HP.)</p>
      <p>Hit Points cannot be reduced below 0 by any means.</p>
      <h2>Resting</h2>
      <p>Resting is the primary means of regaining lost Hit Points and removing wounds. There are two types of rests: <b>Short Rests</b> and <b>Long Rests</b>. To benefit from a rest, you cannot be <b>Deprived</b>. Deprivation can be incurred through a variety of means, but the most common are exhaustion, starvation or thirst.</p>
      <h3>Short Rest</h3>
      <p>On conclusion of a Short Rest, roll a d8 and add your CON bonus. You regain that many Hit Points. Completing a short rest requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 minutes of uninterrupted rest in a safe place.</li>
        <li>A ration (which will not be consumed).</li>
        <li>Must not be Deprived.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Generally, the GM will allow 1-2 Short Rests per Long Rest.</p>
      <h3>Long Rest</h3>
      <p>On conclusion of a Long Rest, you restore all Hit Points and can remove 1 wound. The effects of Critical Wounds linger, however, becoming permanent features on your character sheet. In other words, critical wounds are transformed into Character Features. Completing a Long Rest requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>8 hours of uninterrupted rest in a safe place.</li>
        <li>A ration (which is consumed).</li>
        <li>Must not be Deprived.</li>
      </ul>
