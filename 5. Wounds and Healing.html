      <h1>Wounds and Healing</h1>
      <h2>Death</h2>
      <p>A Player Character will die if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They take a single instance of damage equal to or exceeding double their Hit Point Maximum.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OR:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>They are reduced to 0 Hit Points while already having accumulated 2 wounds.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Taking Wounds</h2>
      <p>When a PC’s Hit Points are reduced to 0, but they aren’t killed, they will take a <a href="5.1 Wounds.html" target="_blank">Wound</a>. The first Wound will always be a Minor Wound, but the second wound may be a Major Wound if the triggering damage exceeds your CON. Wounds have different effects, often determined by the type of damage received. Major Wounds have permanent effects which may significantly impact and transform your character. When you take a Major Wound, you also fall unconscious and can regain consciousness by succeeding a CON check at the beginning of each of your turns.</p>
      <p>After you take a wound, you regain half of your maximum Hit Points, rounded down. (You will always restore a minimum of 1 HP.)</p>
      <p>Hit Points cannot be reduced below 0 by any means.</p>
      <h2>Resting</h2>
      <p>Resting is the primary means of regaining lost Hit Points and removing wounds. There are two types of rests: <b>Short Rests</b> and <b>Long Rests</b>. To benefit from a rest, you cannot be <b>Deprived</b>. Deprivation can be incurred through a variety of means, but the most common are exhaustion, starvation or thirst.</p>
      <h3>Short Rest</h3>
      <p>On conclusion of a Short Rest, roll a d8 and add your CON bonus. You regain that many Hit Points. Completing a short rest requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 minutes of uninterrupted rest in a safe place.</li>
        <li>A ration (which will not be consumed).</li>
        <li>Must not be Deprived.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Generally, the Referee will allow 1-2 Short Rests per Long Rest.</p>
      <h3>Long Rest</h3>
      <p>On conclusion of a Long Rest, you restore all Hit Points and can remove 1 wound. The effects of Major Wounds linger, however, becoming permanent features on your character sheet. In other words, Major Wounds are transformed into Character Features. Completing a Long Rest requires:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>8 hours of uninterrupted rest in a safe place.</li>
        <li>A ration (which is consumed).</li>
        <li>Must not be Deprived.</li>
      </ul>
