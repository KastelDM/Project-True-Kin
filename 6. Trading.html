        <h1>Trading and Bartering</h1>
        <p>The Blue Desert has no coin. Trade is survival, and survival is a story.</p>
        
        <h2>Currency</h2>
        <p>
            Barter rules the desert. There is no universal currency in Vaarn. The closest thing that comes to it is fresh water: a scarce and precious resource in the Blue Desert.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Gnomon, citizens trade Water Tokens — each worth one ration of water at the Water Barons’ banks.</li>
            <li>Synths, however, usually care little for water beyond it's economic value when trading with humans. They prize lubricants, coolants and crypto-tokens above water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thus, fresh water, water tokens, liquor, and other rare/valuable substances are generally used to even an unbalanced trade.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Trading Eligibility</h2>
        <p>The Character Roster on the <a href="0. Campaign Stats.html" target="_blank">Campaign Status</a> page lists your character's status and the markets they have access to. Check it to see if you're eligible to trade. You can trade goods and services in the downtime between game sessions, as long as:
            <ul>
                <li>The GM has announced a <b>Downtime Turn</b> in the Discord chat.</li>
                <li>Your character's status is <b>"Downtime"</b> (You're not in the middle of an adventure).</li>
                <li>You have access to at least one <b>Market</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            Markets are more than shops — they are living economies. A lonely oasis, a desert caravanserai, and the shaded souks of Gnomon can all be unique markets, each with their own scarcities, abundances and local politics. These factors and others can determine the value and availability of goods and services. Some markets you can access merely by geographical proximity and means of travel, but other markets are secret or exclusive, requiring special connections to access.
            
            <h2>Goods &amp; Services</h2>
            <p>No shopping catalogue exists for this game. Instead, use your imagination and expect to find what the world itself offers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Armor, weapons, ammunition</li>
                <li>Food, water, clothing</li>
                <li>Medicine, drugs, vices</li>
                <li>Fuel, mounts, vehicles, tools</li>
                <li>Hirelings and real-estate</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At minimum, you're always going to want to make sure you're stocked up on rations and ammunition, and that your equipment is in good repair.</p>
            
        <h2>How to Trade</h2>
        <p>If you are eligible to trade, you can use your Downtime Turn to make a Trade Offer. Making a Trade offer is simple. Just do the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Name the market you’re trading in.</li>
            <li>List the items you're looking for.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you only want payment, name it.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>List the items you're offering in return.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you’re unsure what to offer, let the market suggest a price.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>Send this information to the GM in a private message. The GM, representing the market or a particular merchant, will answer. From there, you can barter until the deal is struck — or falls through. Merchants and markets can have limited patience and interest. You may have to do some work to sell them on the deal or keep them hooked.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you may freely trade and barter with other players via private message or public posts in the Discord chat. You can only trade with a player if you can access at least one market in common. If you engage another Player in trade and strike a deal, that player must also consume their Downtime Turn to fulfill it. The GM should be kept abreast if players are making a noteworthy trade (such as a rare, high-tech artifact).</p>
