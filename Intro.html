    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <img src="Key Art.png" alt="The blue desert awaits." style="width: 100%;">
    <p>Welcome to Project True-Kin! A Vaults of Vaarn Campaign that you're invited to! (Assuming you are someone I know IRL and not some random skulker on the internet.)</p>
    <p>Vaults of Vaarn is a Science-Fantasy TTRPG originally created by Leo Hunt. Project True-kin is my "hack" of the game and the name of this ugly GitHub site which I've created as a reference for myself and my players.</p>
    <p>Vaarn itself is a strange, far-future, dying earth setting. Think swords and techno-mysticism amid the ruins of a hundred forgotten far futures. You can read Leo's one-page setting intro, <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/what-is-vaarn" target="_blank">"What is Vaarn?"</a> to get the idea.</p>
    <p>Should you choose to accept my invitation and be one of my players, there's some things you should know about Vaults of Vaarn and this campaign specifically:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>While horror is not the game's primary focus, this campaign is likely to feature some body horror and psychological horror elements. Content rating-wise, it's potentially rated "R" except for when it comes to any bedroom stuff, which could be relegated to a PG-13 or cutaway scene or crude allusion. Adult humour is very much allowed — we're just not doing ERP.</li>
        <li>Vaults of Vaarn is an OSR-style game. The definition of OSR is loaded and argued over, but basically it means the game observes a philosophy and style of play more akin to old-school TTRPG's like Advanced Dungeons and Dragons than to modern TTRPG's like 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. If this means nothing to you, don't sweat it. These other points pretty much cover the implications.</li>
        <li>Your character's combat capabilities are limited and your character is fragile at lower levels. This game also has a Wounds system, and it is possible for your character to receive permanent, life-altering injuries. For these reasons, it may be prudent to seek non-violent means of overcoming obstacles where possible.</li>
        <li>However, Vaarn being a Science-Fantasy world, there may exist means of overcoming any injury or illness — however rare or costly. You are also free to retire your character at (almost) any time and create a new one. A retired character may become an NPC.</li>
        <li>There are gaping holes in the rules, and the rules themselves are experimental and subject to change. I will at times be forced to make rulings on the spot or invent a rule. That said, I will do my very best to apply and interpret these rules and rulings consistently, or have a very good reason for choosing not to be consistent. Any explicit written rule change will be communicated before it arises in play — likely in the form of a discord notification and/or a pre-game anouncement and/or accompanying updates to this site.</li>
        <li>My only hard social rule as a referee is that players are not allowed to invite new players to the game without my permission. I am 4/20 and alcohol-friendly, as long as you enjoy responsibly and can pay attention and avoid undue distractions at the table. If myself or any other player deems your substance-related behavior as unacceptable, that behaviour must cease and desist. Please do not drive under the influence. If you have any special social concerns of your own, please let me know what those might be, and we will do our best to accomodate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And that's pretty much it. If you can vibe with all of that, you would make a welcome addition to my table and can <a href="1. Character Creation.html">click here to create your first character</a>. And if you can't vibe, then no hard feelings. Just let me know in any case. :)</p>
