      <H1>Combat Rules</H1>
      <H2>Surprise &amp; Initiative</H2>
      <p>Combat proceeds in turns, alternating between the Player Characters (PCs) and the GM’s forces.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A surprised unit skips its first turn.</li>
        <li>If neither side has clear advantage, roll a die:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Even result: PCs act first.</li>
          <li>Odd result: GM acts first.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <H2>Combat Turns</H2>
      <p>On your side’s turn, each unit may take two actions, in any order or combination:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Move</b></li>
        <li><b>Attack</b></li>
        <li><b>Use</b> an item or special feature</li>
        <li><b>Interact</b> with the environment</li>
        <li><b>Improvise</b> a stunt or other action</li>
        <li><b>Prepare</b> an action to trigger on a set condition (limit 1 prepared action)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, a unit may speak or gesture briefly (about 6 seconds).</p>
      <p></p>
      <H2>Movement</H2>
      <p>How the Move action works depends on the style of play:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Grid combat:</b> Move up to 6 squares (unless noted otherwise). You can break your move up among your other actions (Example: Move 3 squares, attack, move 3 more squares).</li>
        <li><b>Theatre of the Mind:</b> Move to an adjacent area or into a new Range Band relative to your target.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <H2>Attacks</H2>
      <p>Attacks require two rolls: a To-Hit roll and a Damage roll.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>To-Hit Roll:</b> Roll a d20 and add the relevant ability bonus (usually STR for melee, DEX for ranged).</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If the result equals or exceeds the target’s Armour, the attack hits.</li>
          <li>A natural 20 is a critical hit: roll damage dice twice and total them.</li>
          <li>A natural 1 always misses.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>Damage Roll:</b> On a hit, roll your weapon’s damage die. The target loses that many Hit Points.</li>
        <li><b>Efficiency Tip:</b> Roll your To-Hit and Damage dice together. Only apply damage if the attack hits.</li>
        <li><b>Advantage &amp; Disadvantage:</b> Certain conditions grant Advantage (roll 2d20, keep the higher) or Disadvantage (roll 2d20, keep the lower).</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <H2>Engagement &amp; Attacks of Opportunity</H2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are within the 'close' range of an enemy capable of attacking you, you are <b>engaged</b> with that enemy. Likewise, any enemies you are capable of striking are engaged by you.</li>
        <li>While engaged, your ranged attacks are made with Disadvantage.</li>
        <li>If an engaged enemy attempts to move out of your reach, you may make a free melee Attack of Opportunity. Resolve it as a normal Attack.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <H2>Range Bands</H2>
      <p>This game uses abstract Range Bands to represent distance. Ranged and Thrown weapons list their effective range, while Melee weapons generally have a range of 'close'. Ranged attacks made against targets outside a weapon’s range band are rolled with Disadvantage.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Close:</b> Within reach; melee distance. Typically 1 square (2 with 'reach' weapons).</li>
        <li><b>Short:</b> Shotgun range. 2–6 squares.</li>
        <li><b>Mid:</b> Pistol or Rifle range. About 7–20 squares.</li>
        <li><b>Long:</b> Sniper range. About 21–60 squares.</li>
        <li><b>Distant:</b> Barely visible. 61+ squares.</li>
      </ul>
