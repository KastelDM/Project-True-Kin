    <h1>Character Creation</h1>
    <h2>1. Print a Character Sheet and Read the Intro</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To get started, download and print a <a href="1.1 Blank Character Sheet.pdf" target=_blank"">Blank Character Sheet</a>. If it helps you, here's an example of a <a href="1.2 Example Character.pdf" target="_blank">filled one</a>.</li>
            <li>Read the 1-page setting intro, <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/what-is-vaarn" target="_blank">"What is Vaarn?"</a>, then return to these instructions.</li>
        </ol>
    <h2>2. Roll your Abilities</h2>
        <p>
            You have six core Abilities:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strength (STR)</b>: melee attacks, physical power, athletic ability.</li>
            <li><b>Dexterity (DEX)</b>: ranged attacks, speed, poise, finesse.</li>
            <li><b>Constitution (CON)</b>: health recovery, carrying capacity, resistance to elements and intoxicants.</li>
            <li><b>Psyche (PSY)</b>: ammo conservation, perception, judgement, intuition.</li>
            <li><b>Intellect (INT)</b>: searching, general knowledge, language and tech skills (informed by your ancestry and background).</li>
            <li><b>Ego (EGO)</b>: morale, willpower, persuasion, performance, charm, deception.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To determine your ability values, roll 3d6 (three six-sided dice) for each ability, in order. The lowest result of the three dice on each roll is the ability's value.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example: You roll a 2, 2, and 6 for Strength. The lowest die is a 2, so your PC's Strength has a value of 2. Repeat this process for the rest of the abilities and record them on your Character Sheet.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>3. Determine your Background</h2>
        <p>Use the generator below to roll a personality trait and background for your character and record them on your character sheet. Your background is meant to be a loose, but important starting point to help inform your character's history and perspective as you roleplay and explore within Vaarn. it will color how non-player characters might react to you, as well as you to them. It is up to you how and to what extent to interpret the results and significance of this roll, but the Referee is in your corner if you want to bounce ideas. Smart roleplay involves drawing on your background to gain the upper hand in applicable situations, but playing to your weaknesses can also enhance the experience.</p>

    <h2>4. Choose your Ancestry and Give your Character a Name</h2>
        <p>Choose an Ancestry from the table below. Your ancestry defines what type of life-form you are and what <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/tongues-of-vaarn?id=tongues-of-vaarn" target="_blank">languages</a> you know. Each Ancestry has a few rolling tables you may use to inspire your character’s name and appearance. Some of these tables have sparks for demeanour and the like, but the background generator we used in the last step makes them redundant. Only use them if you want your character to be more complex. Finally, each Ancestry also has one or two “Special” features. Be sure to add them to your Features list!</p>
        <table>
            <tbody>
                <tr><th>Ancestry</th><th>Languages known</th><th>Special</th></tr>
