    <h1>Character Creation</h1>
    <h2>1. Print a Character Sheet and Read the Intro</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To get started, download and print a <a href="1.1 Blank Character Sheet.pdf" target=_blank"">Blank Character Sheet</a>. If it helps you, here's an example of a <a href="1.2 Example Character.pdf" target="_blank">filled one</a>.</li>
            <li>Read the 1-page setting intro, <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/what-is-vaarn" target="_blank">"What is Vaarn?"</a></li>
            <li>Ignore the section on the next page and carry on with these instructions, instead. This campaign uses a mixture of house rules and standard rules for Vaalts of Vaarn; so you may (but hopefully seldom) have to jump between these two resources:</li>
                <p></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>KastelDM.github.io/Project-True-Kin is the domain where information specific to our campaign will be held; including house rules observed at our table. You may want to bookmark it!</li>
                    <li>vaarn.github.io, on the other hand, is a public resource containing the original rules authored by the creator of Vaults of Vaarn, Leo Hunt.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
    <h2>2. Roll your Abilities</h2>
        <p>
            Player Characters <b>(PC's)</b> have six core Abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intellect, Psyche, and Ego.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strength (STR)</b>: Used for melee attacks and tasks that require raw physical power or athletic ability.</li>
            <li><b>Dexterity (DEX)</b>: Used for ranged attacks and tasks that require speed, poise, and finesse.</li>
            <li><b>Constitution (CON)</b>: Used for health recovery, carrying capacity, and resistance to the elements.</li>
            <li><b>Intellect (INT)</b>: Used for general knowledge as well as language and tech skills.</li>
            <li><b>Psyche (PSY)</b>: Used for perception, judgment, and intuition.</li>
            <li><b>Ego (EGO)</b>: Used for morale, willpower, persuasion, and deception.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each ability has two related values: a <b>Defense</b> and a <b>Bonus</b>. When creating a PC, roll 3d6 (three six-sided dice) for each of their abilities, in order. The lowest of the three dice on each roll is the ability's bonus. Add 10 to find its defense.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example: You roll a 2, 2, and 6 for Strength. The lowest die is a 2, so your PC's Strength has a bonus of +2 and a defense of 12. Repeat this process for the rest of the abilities and record them on your Character Sheet.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>3. Choose your Ancestry and Give your Character a Name</h2>
        <p>Choose an Ancestry from the table below. Your ancestry determines what type of life-form you are and what <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/tongues-of-vaarn?id=tongues-of-vaarn" target="_blank">languages</a> you can speak.

Be sure to add it to your Features list!</p>
