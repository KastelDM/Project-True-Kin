    <h1>Character Creation</h1>
    <h2>1. Print a Character Sheet and Read the Intro</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To get started, download and print a <a href="1.1 Blank Character Sheet.pdf" target=_blank"">Blank Character
                Sheet</a>. For your reference, here's an example of a <a href="1.2 Example Character.pdf"
                target="_blank">filled one</a>.</li>
        <li>Read the 1-page setting intro, <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/what-is-vaarn" target="_blank">"What is
                Vaarn?"</a>, then return to these instructions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>2. Roll your Abilities</h2>
    <p>
        You have six core Abilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Strength (STR)</b>: melee attacks, readied items, physical power, athletics.</li>
        <li><b>Dexterity (DEX)</b>: ranged attacks, speed, poise, finesse, acrobatics.</li>
        <li><b>Constitution (CON)</b>: health recovery, carrying capacity, resistance to elements and intoxicants.</li>
        <li><b>Psyche (PSY)</b>: ammo conservation, perception, judgement, intuition.</li>
        <li><b>Intellect (INT)</b>: searching, general and specialized knowledge, language and tech skills (informed by Ancestry and Background).</li>
        <li><b>Ego (EGO)</b>: morale, willpower, persuasion, performance, charm, deception.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To determine your Ability values, roll 3d6 (three six-sided dice) for each Ability, in order. The lowest result
        of the three dice on each roll is the Ability's value.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: You roll a 2, 2, and 6 for Strength. The lowest die is a 2, so your PC's Strength has a value of 2.
            Repeat this process for the rest of the abilities and record them on your Character Sheet.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. Determine your Background</h2>
    <p>Use the generator below to roll a personality trait and background for your character and record them on your
        character sheet. Your background is meant to be a loose, but important starting point to help inform your
        character's history and perspective as you roleplay and explore within Vaarn. it will color how non-player
        characters might react to you, as well as you to them. It is up to you how and to what extent to interpret the
        results and significance of this roll, but smart roleplay involves drawing on your background to gain the upper
        hand in applicable situations, and playing to your weaknesses can also enhance your experience.</p>

    <h2>4. Choose your Ancestry and Give your Character a Name</h2>
    <p>Choose an Ancestry from the table below. Your ancestry defines what type of life-form you are and what <a
            href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/tongues-of-vaarn?id=tongues-of-vaarn" target="_blank">languages</a> you
        know. The table has a link for each Ancestry where rolling tables may be found and used to inspire your
        character’s name and appearance. Some of these tables have sparks for demeanour and the like, but the background
        generator we used in the last step makes them redundant. Only use them if you want your character to be more
        complex. Finally, each Ancestry also has one or two “Special” features. Be sure to add them to your Features
        list!</p>
    <table>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Ancestry</th>

                    during the Great Collapse. <br><b>Detritivor</b> - You can consume organic matter in any state of
                    decay and gain nourishment from it. Your healing from Short Rests is doubled if the meal you eat is

    <h2>6. Choose a Mystic Gift or Cybernetic Implant</h2>
    <p>Pick 1 <a href="1.5 Mystic Gifts.html" target="_blank">Mystic Gift</a> or 1 <a href="1.4 Cybernetics.html"
            target="_blank">Cybernetic Implant</a> to add to your Features list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you chose a Cybernetic Implant, be sure to update any relevant Ability values, and keep in mind that you
            may only ever have 1 Cybernetic implant installed per Ability. Each Ability has a ballot box next to it that
            you can shade in to designate an installed implant.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>6. Add items to your Burdens</h2>
    <p>You will notice that your character sheet has some Burden Slots numbered 1 - 20. Follow these instructions to add items to your burdens:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add 5 Rations of water to your Burdens (5 rations can stack in a single Burden Slot).</li>
        <li>If you chose a Mystic Gift in step 6, that gift occupies 1 Burden Slot.</li>
        <li>Roll on each of the <a href="1.3 Starting Gear.html">Starting Gear Tables</a> and add your starting gear to
            your Burdens. Weapons and armor will specify the amount of burden slots they occupy, while ammunition and
            other gear can "stack" multiples of itself in a single slot.</li>
        <li>Finally, roll on the <a href="https://vaarn.github.io/#/exotica" target="_blank">Exotica</a> table for a
            piece of Exotica. This occupies 1 burden slot.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>7. Finishing Touches</h2>
    <p>Fill in these final details on your character sheet:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Level and XP:</b> You are level 1, have 0 current XP and will require 10 XP to advance to level 2.
        </li>
        <li><b>Hit Points (HP):</b> To get your current and maximum Hit Points, roll 1d8. you may re-roll once, but must
            stick with the new result if you do so.</li>
        <li><b>Maximum Burden Slots:</b> Equal to your CON + 10.
            <ul>
                <li>You can indicate your maximum Burden Slots on your character sheet by putting an "X" next to the
                    bottom-most slots. For example, if you have a CON of 1, you have 11 Maximum Burden Slots, and you
                    will put X's next to slots 12 - 20 to signify that they can't be used.</li>
                <li>If the items added to your burdens in step 7 exceed your maximum burden slots, you must choose items
                    to get rid of until nothing occupies an "X'd" slot.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Readied Items:</b> You can "Ready" a number of Burden Slots' worth of items up to your STR + 2. 
            <ul>
                <li>You can indicate Readied slots by putting an "R" next to them. Readied items can be used reactively or in combat without using an action to retrieve them first.</li>
                <li>Worn Items such as armor and clothing do not need to be readied to be used at will, and neither do Mystic Gifts. You can indicate a worn Burden Slot with a "W".</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
