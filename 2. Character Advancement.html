      <h2>Gaining XP</h2>
      <p>To advance your character from level 1 to level 2, you must accumulate 10 XP. When you level up, your XP gets reset to 0, and you must accumulate 5 extra XP per level to level up again.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Level 1 -&gt; 2: 10 XP</li>
        <li>Level 2 -&gt; 3: 15 XP</li>
        <li>Level 3 -&gt; 4: 20 XP</li>
        <li>And so on.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gaining XP is based on a post-session checklist system. At the end of a session, you can award your character XP according to criteria in the <a href="2.1 Post-Session XP Checklist.html">Post-Session XP Checklist</a>. Each checked box awards 1 XP and can only be checked once per session. A single event can only count towards fulfilling one criterion. For example, if you get your arm hacked off, you can’t check both the “Critical Wound” and “Character Growth/Transformation” boxes. You may only check off one or the other. </p>
      <h2>Leveling up</h2>
      <p>When you level up your character, do the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roll a d8. Your current and maximum hit points increase by the amount rolled.</li>
        <li>You may reroll the result once, but you must stick with the new result if you do so.</li>
        <li>Allocate 3 ability points to the ability bonuses of your choosing. Your ability defenses also increase accordingly.</li>
        <li>Abilities can never be raised above +10/20.</li>
        <li>For every ability point you spent in STR, DEX, or CON, give yourself an Energy Point.</li>
        <li>For every ability point you spent in INT, PSY, or EGO, give yourself a Focus Point.</li>
        <li>Roll a d10. On a 10, you can choose a <a href="4.1 Talents.html" target="_blank">Talent</a> to add to your features list.</li>
      </ul>
