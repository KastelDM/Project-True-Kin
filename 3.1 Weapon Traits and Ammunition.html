      <h1>Weapon Traits and Ammunition</h1>
      <p>Each weapon lists its slots, hands required, damage, and any special traits.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>General Weapon Traits</h2>
      <p>Weapons may have the following traits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Slots:</b> How many burden slots the weapon occupies.</li>
        <li><b>2H:</b> Weapons with the 2H tag require 2 hands to use.</li>
        <li><b>Speed:</b> the value added to initiative checks while wielding the weapon.</li>
        <li><b>Range:</b> the weapon's optimal range. Attacks made with a weapon outside of it's optimal range incur disadvantage on the Attack Roll.<ul><li>Some weapons have a range of "C+". This indicates that the weapon is a close-range weapon, but in grid-based combat, it can be used to attack targets up to 2 squares away.</li><li>Throwable weapons have a "Thrown" range in addition to their normal range.</li></ul></li>
        <li><b>Reload:</b> When the natural d20 result of the Attack Roll of an attack made with this weapon is equal to or less than this value, one stack of ammunition is consumed.</li>
        <li><b>Damage:</b> How much damage the weapon deals on a successful hit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Tracking Ammunition</h2>
      <p>To attack with a ranged weapon that has the Reload trait, you must have the appropriate ammunition in your inventory. However, individual projectiles are not tracked. Instead, ranged ammunition is abstracted into "stacks". You lose a stack of ammunition in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reload:</b> Your attack roll triggers a Reload.</li>
        <li><b>After Combat:</b> after an encounter in which you fired your weapon, make a PSY save. The Referee sets the difficulty based on how long and intense the encounter was. On a failure, you lose 1 stack of ammunition for each weapon used during the combat.</li>
      </ul>
