      <h1>Weapon Traits and Ammunition</h1>
      <p>Each weapon lists its slots, hands required, damage, and any special traits.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>General Weapon Traits</h2>
      <p>All weapons share these core properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b># Slots:</b> How many inventory slots the weapon occupies.</li>
        <li><b>Hands (#H):</b> How many free hands are required to attack with the weapon. <em>1H weapons leave a free hand for another weapon, shield, tool, or device.</em></li>
        <li><b>Damage:</b> How much damage the weapon deals on a successful hit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Melee Weapon Traits</h2>
      <p>Some melee weapons have additional properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Thrown (Range):</b> You may make a ranged attack by throwing the weapon. Attacks beyond this range are made with disadvantage.</li>
        <li><b>Reach:</b> In grid-based combat, you may make melee attacks against targets up to 2 squares away.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Ranged Weapon Traits</h2>
      <p>Ranged weapons often include the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reload (#):</b> When you attack and your natural attack roll is less than or equal to this number, one stack of ammunition is consumed.</li>
        <li><b>Misfire (#):</b> The same as a reload; except the attack also automatically fails, even if the attack roll was high enough to penetrate the target's armour.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h2>Tracking Ammunition</h2>
      <p>To attack with a ranged weapon that has the Reload or Misfire traits, you must have the appropriate ammunition in your inventory. However, individual projectiles are not tracked. Instead, ranged ammunition is abstracted into stacks. You lose a stack of ammunition in the following circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Reload/Misfire:</b> Your attack roll triggers Reload or Misfire.</li>
        <li><b>After Combat:</b> after an encounter in which you fired your weapon, make a PSY save. The GM sets the difficulty based on how long and intense the encounter was. On a failure, you lose 1 stack of ammunition.</li>
      </ul>
