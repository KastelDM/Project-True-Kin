    <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Welcome to <b>Project True-Kin</b> — a Vaults of Vaarn campaign.
If you’re reading this, you’ve likely been invited because I think you’d be a good fit at the table.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>What This Is</h2>

<p>
<b>Vaults of Vaarn</b> is a science-fantasy tabletop RPG created by 
Leo Hunt.
It’s set in a far-future, dying-earth world of blue deserts, lost technologies, and half-remembered civilizations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Project True-Kin</b> is my personal hack of the system, and this site exists as a shared reference for me and my players.
</p>

<p>
If you want a fast, official overview of the setting, read the one-page intro:

<h2>What Vaarn Feels Like</h2>

<p>
Vaarn is a place of swords, techno-mysticism, and forgotten futures layered atop forgotten futures.
Civilizations rise from ruins they barely understand.
</p>

<p>
While horror is not the campaign’s primary focus, you should expect:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Occasional <b>body horror</b> or <b>psychological horror</b> themes</li> 
  <li>An overall content tone roughly equivalent to an <b>R-rated film</b></li>
  <li>Meanwhile any X-rated stuff will merely be alluded to rather than described or acted out in full detail.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>How This Campaign Plays</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>This is an OSR-style game.</b><br>
    That means problem-solving, player ingenuity, and meaningful risk matter more than character builds or balance.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Characters are fragile.</b><br>
    Combat is dangerous, especially at low levels. Permanent injury and death are possible.
    Seeking non-violent solutions is often wise.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Death isn’t always the end.</b><br>
    Characters can be retired voluntarily and may return as NPCs.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>The rules are living.</b><br>
    This rules system is barebones and experimental. There are gaps.
    I will make on-the-spot rulings when needed and strive for consistency.
    Any explicit rule changes or updates will be communicated clearly before they matter in play.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Table Expectations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Inviting new players requires my approval.</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>4/20- and alcohol-friendly</b>, provided everyone remains attentive and respectful, and obeys the rules of the host and venue.
    If substance-related behaviour becomes disruptive, it must stop.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>No driving to or from sessions under the influence.</b>
  </li>

  <li>
    If you have any personal boundaries or social concerns, let me know.
    We’ll do our best to accommodate and may even be able to update this list.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>
If all of this sounds like something you can vibe with, you’re more than welcome at the table.
